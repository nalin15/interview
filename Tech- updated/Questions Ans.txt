•             Participate actively in requirement gathering, detailed design, code reviews, and bug
discussions and drive discussion around appropriate solutions.
•             Influence the design, code, and architecture of applications by reviewing requirements,
functional specifications, design, data models, code, and test plans.
•             Ability to work independently is very important.
•             Should be able to work in a 24x7, fast paced and pressing environment.
•             Depending on the project need, should have flexibility to work in any shift, including
night shift.
